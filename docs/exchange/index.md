# Join Our Community

If you have WeChat, you can join our group chat or add me directly. Please note:

1. **Group chat is strongly recommended** - Many issues may have already been solved by other members.
2. **Collective problem-solving** - Discussions help compile common issues and solutions for everyone's benefit.
3. **Direct assistance** - If no solution exists, @mention me and I'll respond when available.
4. **Group access** - If the QR code expires or the group is full, add my WeChat for an invitation.
5. **Private consultation** - For 1-on-1 support, please sponsor PakePlus first.
6. **Alternative contact** - Submit GitHub issues if WeChat isn't convenient.
7. **Efficiency notice** - Please follow these protocols as I have limited availability.
8. **Group rules**:
   - Technical discussions only
   - No ads/spam/off-topic content
   - Prohibited: political, religious, violent, pornographic, or terrorist content
