# Basic Configuration  

After creating your project, you'll need to configure some basic settings. These include your app name, the URL to package, the app identifier (ID), and the version number. The first four fields are required, while the rest can be configured based on your needs.  

- **App Name**: Supports Chinese, English, etc., but no spaces.  
- **Website URL**: Can be a local or web address, but must start with `http://` or `https://`. Alternatively, you can use a local HTML file or a `dist` folder from a Vue/React build.  
- **App ID**: A unique identifier for your software (cannot be duplicated across projects).  
- **Version Number**: Used to distinguish different versions of your app.
