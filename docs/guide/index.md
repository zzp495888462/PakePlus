# PakePlus Guide

PakePlus is a packaging tool based on Tauri2 and GitHub. You can also call me PP or 2P🫣. With just a GitHub Token, you can package any website/Vue/React project's static `dist` files into a cross-platform desktop application. It’s compact (less than 5M) and high-performance, while PakePlus itself is only about 8M. <span style="color:red">in order to avoid excessive pressure on Github servers caused by excessive use, PakePlus has implemented restrictions: only one project can be created and published one hourly!</span>

Compared to Pake, the advantages are:

1. Pake requires installing a complex and bloated Rust and Node dependency environment locally, which can take up several GB of your computer's storage—my hard drive just can’t handle that...
2. No need to understand command lines or complicated configurations. PakePlus offers a graphical interface where you can complete packaging tasks with just a few clicks, so easy that even a elementary school student could do it 😌.
3. I also tried Tauri2 for mobile, but I couldn’t stand its bloat. Instead, I used native Android and iOS frameworks for packaging and compilation. It also allows releasing debug versions on mobile for easier development and testing.

-   🍀 **Static file packaging**—just drop your Vue/React project’s `dist` folder or `index.html`, and it becomes a desktop app (why keep it just a website?)
-   🐞 **Debug mode**—find and fix bugs during preview or release stages
-   💬 **Join our tech community** anytime if you encounter issues

## Use Cases

-   Turn **any website into a desktop app** instantly, making it look more professional.

PakePlus supports installation packages for both ARM and Intel architectures. Popular program installation packages typically only include the ARM version (M-series chips) for Mac, the Intel (x64) version for Windows, and the x64 version for Linux. If you need installation packages for additional architectures, you can use PakePlus to compile custom packages tailored to your specific needs.
