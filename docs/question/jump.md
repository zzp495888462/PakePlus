# Window Redirection Issue

A common problem occurs when clicking links in the compiled application causes:
- Opening a separate window
- Launching the default browser to load the page

**Solution Implemented:**
The default JavaScript script already includes code to prevent this behavior. If you haven't modified the default scripts, this issue should not occur.

**If you encounter this problem:**
1. First verify you haven't removed/modified the default scripts
2. If the issue persists, you may contact me for assistance

⚠️ **Important Notice:**
Do NOT remove the default script code. Any modifications to these scripts are made at your own risk!
