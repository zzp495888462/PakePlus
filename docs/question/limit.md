# Limits

<div style="color:red">in order to avoid excessive pressure on Github servers caused by excessive use, PakePlus has implemented restrictions: only one project can be created and only one release can be made per day!</div>  
Why add this restriction? Many people may ask. Friends before May 13, 2025 should know the reason, as my GitHub account was banned on April 30, 2025. When you wake up in the morning and find a GitHub prompt:

```shell
Received a 403 error. Data returned as aString was: f"message":"Sorry. Your
account was
suspended.""documentation url"."https://docs.qithub.com/
graphgl""status":"403"
```  

You will know that things are not going well.   

Because the compilation environment used by PakePlus is provided by GitHub, when more people use PakePlus, it will put pressure on the GitHub server. Thank you very much for the free service provided by GitHub. So in order not to put pressure on the GitHub server and not to block my GitHub account again, this restriction has been added.
