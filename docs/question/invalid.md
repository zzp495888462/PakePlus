# Invalid Token  

This occurs because the GitHub token wasn't granted the required permissions during creation.  

### Solution:  
Follow the [GitHub Token Guide](../guide/token.md) to regenerate your token with proper permissions.  

**Recommendation:**  
While granting all permissions will work (and is safest), PakePlus actually only needs:  
- `repo` (full control of private repositories)  
- `workflow` (GitHub Actions access)  
- `user` (read user profile data)  

For security, only enable what's needed rather than all permissions.  

> 🔍 *Tip: If you previously created a token, you may need to revoke and recreate it for new permissions to take effect.*
