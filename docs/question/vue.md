# Packaging Vue/React Projects  

After building your Vue/React project, upload the contents of the `dist` folder to the server.  

### Important Notes:  
- The uploaded folder **must contain** an `index.html` file.  
- Individual files in the folder **cannot exceed 10MB** in size.  
- Static resources (images, videos, etc.) **should use external links** whenever possible.
