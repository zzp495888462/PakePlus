# Packaging HTML Projects

You need to store your HTML files in a folder, and it must include an index.html file.  
Then click the upload button next to the website address field, select your folder, and click upload.

# Important Notes

- The uploaded folder **must contain** an index.html file.  
- Individual files in the folder **cannot exceed 10MB** in size.  
- Static resources (images, videos, etc.) are **recommended to use external links** whenever possible.
